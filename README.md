## Overview
This repository is a frontend application for issuing ACDC as an Issuer, specifically for issuing LE vLEI Credentials.

The main processes are found in `modules/repository.ts` and consist of the following two components:

- **SignifyRepository Interface**: The implementation instance encapsulates the Signify library and provides abstracted methods to each view.
- **Signifies Class**: A companion class to the SignifyRepository interface, equipped with factory methods and more.

The screen transitions start from `Init.vue`. For routing details, please refer to `router/index.ts`.

To run this, a KERIA Agent and a Witness are required.
